## Employee Churn Prevention ML

In this project, I built and trained multiple machine learning algorithm to predict whether an employee will quit in the near future. Following research questions were investigated:
Which column contributes how strongly to the employee's decision? 
Can certain changes be made to persuade an employee with intentions 
to quit to change his or her mind? (Columns with the greatest impact). The probabilty aim of employees with intentions to quit should be at least by 90%. 
Data was obtained from kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/hamzaben/employee-churn-model-w-strategic-retention-plan/data, 
containing  observations with 35 attributes like age, education, job satisfaction, and work-life-balance. 
I performed exploratory data analysis and data visualization on the data set. Overall 

I prepared the data and splitted into training and test dataset before training. Decision Tree Classifier, 
using sci-kit learn was evaluated as the best model. (Training set: 89%) But further improvments need to be done.
